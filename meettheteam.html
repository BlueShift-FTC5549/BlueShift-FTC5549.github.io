                GABRIEL WONG - Hi I'm Gabe, I'm 16, and I'm a senior at Asheville School. I'm a boarder, but outside
                of Asheville school I live in the Bahamas. I'm the head of the programming team. I joined the robotics
                team because I really like technology and it was the most technologically oriented thing at Asheville 
                School my freshman year. I'm excited to see how we are going to do in competition. My favorite fruits 
                are grapes!
